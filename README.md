# Q4-game-project-2
The name of the game is "Crypto Miner". It essentially is a variant of the game dig dug,
but Crypto Miner has a few variations in comparison to its parent game. For starters, the player controlled class is able to 
move diagonally instead of being locked to North, South, East, and West. Additionally, the enemy, Kirby, is able to also move 
diagonally, and subtracts points from the player's total score rather than losing a life like in the original game.


The people that created this project are as follows: Morgan Pham, John Tran, Patrick McCullough. This project was originally
created and conceived in the week of 3/28/2022

The current status of the game as of 5/26/2022 is "Completed". The enemy object moves about the screen correctly, the player 
controlled player is able to move smoothly and coin and kirby collision is pretty accurate. Everything in the game should 
work as intended.
